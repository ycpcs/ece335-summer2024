Book Questions from *How To Prove It - 2nd ed.*
===============================================

1.5.6 (pg. 56), Ex. 2.1.3 1-4 (pg. 62)

2.1.1 (pg. 66), 2.1.4 (pg. 67)

2.2.1 a-b (pg. 76), 2.2.12 a-c (pg. 77)


*Hints:*

> 1.5.6 - Either give a truth table showing the equivalence or manipulate one of the statements using the logical equivalence laws into the other.
> 
> Ex. 2.1.3 - Be careful when interpreting the quantifiers to be sure you translate them either to universal or existential forms appropriately. Again try not to use the book when doing the problem.
> 
> 2.1.1 - Convert the statement in small steps from English to symbols starting with the quantifiers.
> 
> 2.1.4 Start with a literal translation and then gradually make the English more natural sounding. Try to make the final statement as concise as possible.
> 
> 2.2.1 Start by writing the original statement symbolically. Then negate the symbolic statement and move the negation sign through the formula using the quantifier negation laws and other logical equivalencies until none of the quantifiers are negated. Then translate the final negated statement back to English.
> 
> 2.2.12 Consider carefully who the "!" (interpreted as "exactly one" or "only one") applies to when forming the English statement.
