Book Questions from *How To Prove It - 3rd ed.*
===============================================

Intro. 4 (pg. 7), 1.1.3 (pg. 13)

1.1.6 (pg. 14), Ex. 1.2.7 (pg. 23)

1.2.12 (pg. 25), 1.5.4 (pg. 56)


*Hints:*

> Intro. 4 - Consider Theorem 4 on pg. 5-6
>
> 1.1.3 - Show your statements for *P* and *Q*
>
> 1.1.6 - Write out the literal translation of the logical expression first, then rewrite it in more natural English
>
> Ex. 1.2.7 - Attempt to manipulate the expression using the various equivalence laws, showing which law is applied at each step, to create tautologies or contradictions to eliminate parts of the expression (Try to do the problem without referring to the example)
>
> 1.2.12 - Attempt to manipulate the expressions using the various equivalence laws, showing which law is applied at each step, to create tautologies or contradictions to eliminate parts of the expressions
>
> 1.5.4 - Start out by rewriting the arguments symbolically. Then construct the truth table for all the statements and check if the conclusion is T only when all the premises are T.
