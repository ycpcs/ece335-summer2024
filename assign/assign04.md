Book Questions from *How To Prove It - 3rd ed.*
===============================================

2.3.1 (pg. 86), 2.3.8 (pg. 87)

2.3.11 (pg. 87), 3.1.8 (pg. 99)

3.1.12 (pg. 100), 3.2.6 (pg. 112)


*Hints:*

> 2.3.1 - Refer to Examples 2.3.1 on pg. 74 and 2.3.3 on pg. 76 for examples of how to formulate your answers.
> 
> 2.3.8 - Since there are two indices in *I* there will be two *A*<sub>i</sub>'s and two *B*<sub>i</sub>'s in the families. Based on part (b), does family intersection distribute over family union?
> 
> 2.3.11 - Begin with the statement *x* ∈ ℘(*A* ∩ *B*) noting that this means that *x* is a *set*. Therefore to show the equivalence, show that *every* element in *x* (perhaps denote by *y*) is in ℘(*A*) ∩ ℘(*B*). Start by applying the definition of power set and working inward until all the set notation has been removed. Then manipulate the statement with logical equivalencies and finally using the set definitions to deduce the set equivalency.
> 
> 3.1.8 - Begin by applying the conditional proof form to write the set of givens and goal. Then use set definitions (similar to the previous section) to rewrite the set expression in its logical form. Manipulate the logical form using the givens to reduce it until the goal is reached. You should show your scratch work, but remember that the final statement of the *proof* should *not* show the scratch work, but be a concise progression of justified steps leading to the conclusion.
> 
> 3.1.12 - Consider proof by *contrapositive*. Construct the contrapositive and then state the givens of goals to prove the theorem.
> 
> 3.2.6 - Use *proof by contradiction* to provide an alternative proof of Example 3.2.1. Assume that *a* ∈ *A*\\*B* and deduce a contradiction. Note what this assumption states regarding whether or not *a* ∈ *A* and thus *A* ∩ *C*.
