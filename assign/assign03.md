Book Questions from *How To Prove It - 2nd ed.*
===============================================

1.3.2 (pg. 34), 1.3.5 (pg. 34)

1.3.9 (pg. 35), 1.4.1 (pg. 43)

1.4.5 (pg. 43), 1.4.10 (pg. 44)


*Hints:*

> 1.3.2 - Refer to Example 1.3.1 on pg. 26 for examples of how to translate to logical forms.
> 
> 1.3.5 - Recall that *free* variables are elements that are either in or not in the truth set for the statement while *bound* variables simply are used to specify the elementhood test.
> 
> 1.3.9 - Consider in the statements which are the bound and which are the free variables.
> 
> 1.4.1 Refer to the definitions for ∪, ∩, and \\. Note that subsets must contain *all* the elements of the superset.
> 
> 1.4.5 Use the identities from problem 1.4.4 as a guideline for the result, i.e. use logical equivalences to manipulate the left hand side into the right. Also construct Venn diagrams to help visualize where the elements live with respect to the sets.
> 
> 1.4.10 Refer to the proof of Theorem 1.4.7 on pg. 41 and the discussion that follows the theorem to determine when the result is a *proper subset* of *A* and not the entire set *A*. Then use identities to prove part b.
