Book Questions from *How To Prove It - 3rd ed.*
===============================================

3.5.2 (pg. 150)

6.1.2 (pg. 278), 6.1.15 (pg. 279)

6.3.1 (pg. 299), 6.3.6 (pg. 300)

5.3.6 (pg. 257)


*Hints:*

> 3.5.2 - Note that the unions will produce disjuntions (since union implies **or**). Thus construct two cases to show *x* ∈ *A* or alternatively that *x* ∈ (*B* \\ *C*) and that these two cases cover all possibilities.

> 6.1.2 - Verify that it is true for *n* = 0, then write out the left hand side for *n*+1 and use the assumption that the equality is true for *n* to prove the right hand side for *n*+1.

> 6.1.15 - Initially verify that it is true for *n* = 10. Then show that *n*<sup>3</sup> \> 10*n*<sup>2</sup>. Then start with 2<sup>n+1</sup> and use the assumption that the inequality is true for *n* along with the previous fact to show \> *n*<sup>3</sup>. (Actually it can be shown that 2<sup>n</sup> is greater than *any* polynomial for sufficiently large *n*).

> 6.3.1 - Write out the first few values for *n* = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and notice a pattern relating to *n*. Then prove it using induction.

> 6.3.6 - Straight forward application of proof by induction.

> 5.3.6 - Start by sketching a graph for *f*. Then consider what the *range* of *f* needs to be in order for the function to be *one-to-one*, i.e. so that no two *x* values produce the same *f(x)*. Then consider any further restrictions required to make *f* *onto*, i.e. so that *every* value of *B* has a corresponding *x*. With this restricted domain, determine *f* <sup>-1</sup>.
